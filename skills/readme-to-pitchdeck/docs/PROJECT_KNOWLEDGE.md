# README to Pitch Deck — project knowledge

## Current state

Version 0.1.0 is a deterministic local compiler. It reads local Markdown sources,
extracts candidate claims and referenced images, emits typed YAML manifests, validates
public/private and qualifier boundaries, builds editable 16:9 PPTX files, reopens them for
structural verification, and can render PDF/PNG/contact sheets with Linux tools.

## Durable decisions

- README prose is never auto-approved.
- Public/private filtering is a hard build boundary.
- Status/proof claims are high risk and require qualifiers.
- Mandatory non-claims are first-class claim-ledger entries.
- Missing required assets fail closed; optional gaps remain visible.
- PPTX is the portable editable interchange; Google Slides is a human tuning surface.
- Manifests and receipts, not the cloud deck, are the source-controlled truth.

## Known gaps

- README-to-slide planning is heuristic and deliberately conservative.
- The compiler does not inspect the repository implementation to verify README claims.
- It does not call web search, GitHub, Google Slides, image generation, or an LLM.
- It does not compare rendered slides to a design template.
- It does not guarantee pixel-identical Google Slides import.
- Visual approval remains a contact-sheet and human-review step.

## Future promotion gates

Before adding autonomous research or rewriting:

1. add an `agentic-evals` fixture with positive, negative, and adversarial trials;
2. retain deterministic claim/source validation before optional LLM judgment;
3. make external network effects opt-in and receipt-bound;
4. add a native Google Slides API adapter only after OAuth/config doctor and export
   round-trip tests exist;
5. add image regeneration as a separate composed skill rather than hiding it in the
   compiler.

## Readiness

- Deterministic planning/build/verify: `USABLE_WITH_GAPS` until installed `sanity.sh`
  passes on the target workstation.
- Google Slides visual handoff: `NOT_ESTABLISHED` until a generated deck is imported and
  reviewed there.
- Automated factual verification against a codebase: `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
