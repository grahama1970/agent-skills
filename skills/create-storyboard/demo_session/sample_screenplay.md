INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

[LIGHTING: Low key, practical desk lamp only]
[REF: Blade Runner 2049 apartment scene]

SARAH enters the dark apartment, flipping on a small desk lamp.

SARAH
(whispering)
Hello? Is anyone here?

She moves cautiously through the room.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (O.S.)
I've been waiting for you.

Sarah spins around, fear in her eyes.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Cars rush by. People hurry along the sidewalk.

SARAH walks determinedly, phone pressed to her ear.

SARAH
I need backup. Now.
