      "question": "How does network isolation mitigate lateral movement by adversaries?",
      "reasoning": "Network isolation involves techniques like VLANs and firewalls to restrict traffic between systems. By limiting communication pathways, adversaries who gain initial access find it harder to move laterally across the network.",
      "answer": "Network isolation mitigates lateral movement by restricting network traffic between systems using VLANs and firewalls, reducing the attack surface available to adversaries.",
