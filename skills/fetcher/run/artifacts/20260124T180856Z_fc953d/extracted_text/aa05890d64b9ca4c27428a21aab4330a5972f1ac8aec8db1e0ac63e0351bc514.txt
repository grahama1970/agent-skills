Hassle-free time tracking using Elgato Stream Deck and Toggl Track
Just search for the Action "Toggl" within the Stream Deck app and install it. There is a button called "Toggl" available in section "Custom".
- Title is a default Stream Deck property available for every button in Stream Deck. You should leave it empty (see Button Label).
- API Token is your private API Token you can get from your Toggl profile. This Token is handled like a password. Don't share it. Required.
- Button Label is used instead of Title. If the tracker isn't running, the Label is shown on the button. If the tracker is running the elapsed time is shown additionally. If Title is set, it will override Button Label.
- Entry Name describes the activity you want to report. It is not required but strongly recommended.
- Workspace is your workspace you start the time entries in. Required.
- Project is the project you want to assign the task to. Leave blank for no project. New projects can be added in Toggl.
- Billable sets Toggl's billable flag (for Toggl paid plans only).
Just press any Toggl Button to start tracking time. The button should indicate tracking by turning red and showing the current tracking time (if no Title is set). The status of the button is defined by workspace, project and entry name. If you setup two identical buttons (even on different Stream Deck profiles), both button indicate the same. If you start or stop your timer using the Toggl app (web, desktop, mobile) Toggl for Stream Deck will follow by changing the status.

- Changing the Button Label wont change the Title immediately. Restart Stream Deck.
