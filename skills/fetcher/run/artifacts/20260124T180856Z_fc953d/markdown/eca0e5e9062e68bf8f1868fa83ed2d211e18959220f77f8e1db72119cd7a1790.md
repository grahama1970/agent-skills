- Install all the dependencies

`yarn`

- Build the project for the first time, the project uses Parcel as bundler to handle React and TypeScript

`yarn build`

- Create a symlink form the folder you clone the repository

`ln -s devops-streamdeck/dist/dev.santiagomartin.devops.sdPlugin ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/Plugins/dev.santiagomartin.devops.sdPlugin`

- Run the proper dev command, since we are using Parcel to build the project we have a few dev commands to start Parcel in watch mode

```
// For Property Inspector
yarn:dev:pi
// For Plugin
yarn:dev:plugin
// For setup screen, where the user add the configuration for each service
yarn:dev:setup
```
